Reload Counter
====
Displays your current remaining full reloads instead of your remaining ammo. I made this for someone with OCD for accessibility reasons.

## Known issues

- The ammo counter on the weapon still displays total ammo remaining.
- The ammo counter will very briefly display the remaining ammo count before switching. This results in a bit of jitter when it tries to resize the window.
- There are no config options.

### Credits

- Gorflow, who makes some excellent UI mods, for directing me to certain specific things I needed to target to make this work.
- GoldBl4d3, for putting up with my incredibly stupid questions on the DRG Modding Discord.
