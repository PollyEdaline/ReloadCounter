Reload Counter
====
All this does currently is display your current remaining full reloads above your ammo counter. I made this for my partner, who has mild OCD (the actual disorder). In the future, I would like to change this to override the total ammo display, but I have very limited programming/blueprint knowledge. I made this for accessibility reasons.

I could really use some help with improving this mod. It was already a struggle to get just this working, and I am having a lot of trouble implementing a few things I want to add. Most notably, I would like it to override the total ammo by default, with a config option to instead show it as a separate UI element. I have tried to figure this out on my own but it just won't work for me. I am out of ideas. If someone can please help, my Discord is Pollychan#8281, or you can message me here on mod.io. Thank you.

## Known issues

- There are no config options currently. A few that I would like to add, but don't know how:
  - Ability to switch between overriding the total ammo display, or displaying separately
  - Ability to move and resize separated display
  - Ability to rename separated display
  - Ability to round reload count up or down (currently, it rounds down)

### Credits

- Gorflow, who makes some excellent UI mods, for directing me to certain specific things I needed to target to make this work.
- GoldBl4d3, for putting up with my incredibly stupid questions on the DRG Modding Discord.
