Reload Counter
====
All this does is display your current remaining full reloads instead of your remaining ammo. I made this for my partner, who has mild OCD (the actual disorder). I made this for accessibility reasons.

This does not remove the total amount of ammo from your gun's viewmodel. I don't know how to do this. However, my partner said she prefers it that way, so unless someone can help me make a config option for that, it will stay that way.

I could really use some help with improving this mod. It was already a struggle to get just this working, and I am having a lot of trouble implementing a few things I want to add. Most notably, configuration options. I have tried to figure this out on my own but it just won't work for me. If you can help me, my Discord is Pollychan#8281, or you can message me on mod.io. Thank you.

## Known issues

- The ammo counter will very briefly display the remaining ammo count before switching. This results in a bit of jitter when it tries to resize the window. I don't know how to fix this right now, sorry.
- There are no config options currently. A few that I would like to add, but don't know how:
  - Ability to switch between overriding the total ammo display, or displaying separately
  - Ability to move and resize separated display
  - Ability to rename separated display
  - Ability to round reload count up or down (currently, it rounds down)
